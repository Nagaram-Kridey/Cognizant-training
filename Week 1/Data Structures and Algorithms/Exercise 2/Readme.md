# Ecommerce Search Example

A simple Java program demonstrating **Linear Search** and **Binary Search** on an e-commerce product list.

## Research:

For huge product catalogs, binary search (with sorted arrays or better, a Tree or database index) is much faster.

If products are stored in a database with indexes (which is typical), the underlying database engine already uses B-tree or similar structures â€” giving O(log n) or better.

For real-time UI filtering (search-as-you-type), a binary search or hash-based structure (HashMap) is better.


## How to Run

1. Save the code
2. Compile
```
javac EcommerceSearchExample.java
```
3. Run:
```
java EcommerceSearchExample
```
