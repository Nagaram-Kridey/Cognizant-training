# PL/SQL Practice Exercises

This project contains three basic PL/SQL exercises involving control structures like loops and conditional checks.

## Folder Structure

- `scenarios/` - Contains each exercise as a separate `.sql` file
- `setup/` - Contains SQL scripts to create and populate the tables

## Exercises

1. **scenario1_discount.sql** - Apply a 1% discount to loan interest rates for customers over 60.
2. **scenario2_vip_flag.sql** - Promote customers with balance over $10,000 to VIP.
3. **scenario3_loan_reminders.sql** - Print reminders for loans due within 30 days.

## How to Run

1. Run `create_tables.sql` and `insert_sample_data.sql` from `setup/` folder.
2. Execute each script inside `scenarios/` as needed.
3. Use `drop_tables.sql` to reset the environment.
